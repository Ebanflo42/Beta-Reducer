# Beta-Reducer
A Haskell progam that beta-reduces Lambda Expressions. Compile with `ghc` and run with `./Main`.

Syntax:

A variable can be represented with any string which does not contain any of the characters `().\\` or whitespace.

An abstraction is written `\x.y`.

Applications must use parantheses: `(expression1) (expression2)`
